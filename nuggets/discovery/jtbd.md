# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

In the early 1980s, one of the founding thinkers of marketing Theodore Levitt wrote “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole”. He argued that customers are not looking for a product — they are looking for a solution. 

Popularised by Clay Christensen in his book, The Innovator’s Solution, Jobs To Be Done, or JTBD, refers to the progress an individual is hoping to make in their life. A “job” is what the person is really seeking to accomplish in a given situation. The idea is that people hire products or services to fulfill a certain job in their lives. A job goes beyond simply accomplishing a functional task. There is often a social or emotional element to a job and why an individual may choose to hire a product over an alternative. Christensen uses the example of the milkshake to demonstrate how JTBD can be applied in a real scenario.

In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and interaction design, this subject is written in depth by Don Norman, in his 1988 book “The Design of Everyday Things”. 

And in 2005, Anthony Ulwick launched ‘Outcomes-Driven Innovation’ and published the book ‘What Customers Want”.

TLDR; JTBD is for understanding user needs based on what they are trying to accomplish. It focuses on the user's goals and motivations, not just product features.
