# Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a psychological theory proposed by Abraham Maslow that organises human motivations into five ascending levels, often illustrated as a pyramid. Each level represents a category of needs, and higher levels become relevant only after lower-level needs are sufficiently met.

The 5 Levels of the Pyramid:
1. Physiological Needs â€“ Food, water, shelter, rest
2. Safety Needs â€“ Personal and financial security, health, stability
3. Love & Belonging â€“ Relationships, friendships, community
4. Esteem Needs â€“ Self-respect, recognition, achievement
5. Self-Actualization â€“ Fulfilling personal potential, creativity, purpose
