# Rocks, Pebbles, Sand

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

This metaphor helps prioritizs and structure time by separating tasks into:
- Rocks â€“ Big, strategic to maximise impact
- Pebbles â€“ Mid, tactical to maximise return of investment (ROI)
- Sand â€“ Small tasks or details to maximise throughput

Fill your schedule with rocks first to ensure long-term goals are met â€” the rest fills in around them.
