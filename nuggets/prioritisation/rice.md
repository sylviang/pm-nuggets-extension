# RICE Score

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

The RICE framework, a prioritisation method originated at Intercom. The framework is based on four factors: Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, and provides a consistent way to evaluate and prioritise initiatives.

The RICE framework's key factors are:
- Reach: How many people or users will be impacted by the initiative? 
- Impact: How much will each person be impacted? 
- Confidence: How confident are you in your estimates of reach and impact? 
- Effort: How much effort (measured in person-months) will it take to implement the initiative?
