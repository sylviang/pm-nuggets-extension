From Silicon Valley Product Group, SVPG, Marty Cagan explicitly call out the four types of risk in the new edition of his book, INSPIRED.

1. value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it)  
2. usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)  
3. feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have)  
4. business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)
