# Subscription

_Last updated: 2025-07-19_

Subscription pricing charges customers a recurring fee (monthly, yearly) to access a product or service. It's one of the most common monetization models for digital products.

Benefits:
- Predictable recurring revenue
- Strong incentives for retention and engagement
- Easier to upsell with tiers or bundles

Common in SaaS, streaming, consumer products, and even hardware-as-a-service.
