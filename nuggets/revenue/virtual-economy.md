# Virtual Economy

_Last updated: 2025-07-19_

A virtual economy refers to the trade and monetization of digital goods, currencies, and services â€” often within games or platforms.

It involves:
- In-game currency and assets
- Digital marketplaces and NFTs
- Creator ecosystems and monetized experiences

PMs should understand how digital scarcity, tokenization, and player behaviour shape engagement.
