# Candy vs Vitamins vs Painkillers

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

In product development, painkillers solve an urgent, painful problem, while vitamins are nice-to-haves that improve quality of life but aren't critical.

Why it matters:
- Painkillers are easier to monetize and market (people pay to remove pain).
- Vitamins often require stronger branding or emotional appeal to gain adoption.

The ideal product starts as a painkiller â€” solving a real, high-frequency problem â€” and evolves into a vitamin, expanding its value and engagement.
