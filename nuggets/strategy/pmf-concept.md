# Product/Market Fit

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

Product/Market fit is a concept that originated from Andy Rachleff of Benchmark Capital and Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital, and later popularised by Marc Andreessen in the mid-2000s. Andreessen, stated “the only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit,” defined it as being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. It is commonly understood as creating a minimum viable product that effectively solves a real problem. Steve Blank positioned product-market fit as a step in between customer validation and customer creation in his book The Four Steps to the Epiphany.

Indicators of lacking product/market fit include slow user growth, weak customer engagement, and prolonged sales cycles. Conversely, when product/market fit is achieved, customer demand surges, usage grows rapidly, and positive word-of-mouth spreads. Startups should focus intensely on reaching this fit, even if it requires significant changes to the product, team, or market strategy. Once attained, product/market fit often compensates for other operational shortcomings, underscoring its vital role in a startup's trajectory.
