# Double Diamond

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

The Double Diamond design process is a structured, four-phase approach developed by the British Design Council to guide design and innovation projects. It involves Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver phases, moving from broad problem exploration to focused solution implementation. 

- **Discover**: This phase focuses on understanding the problem by exploring, researching, and gathering information through various methods like interviews, surveys, and user observation.
- **Define**: The goal here is to refine and clearly define the problem based on the insights gathered during the Discover phase.
- **Develop**: This phase involves generating a wide range of ideas and developing potential solutions, often through brainstorming, prototyping, and user testing.
- **Deliver**: The final phase focuses on finalizing the chosen solution, testing it rigorously, and implementing it, including post-implementation evaluation.
