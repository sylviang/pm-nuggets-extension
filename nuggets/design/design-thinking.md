> Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. â€“ Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO

It encourages divergent thinking and experimentation to create solutions that are both desirable, feasible and viable. The 5 phases:
Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.
