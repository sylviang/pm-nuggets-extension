# The Hooked Model

_Last updated: 2025-07-19_

Coined by Nir Eyal, the Hooked Model explains how habit-forming products keep users coming back by triggering behavior loops. Used by products like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok to create user habits.

The 4-Step Loop:
1. **Trigger** â€“ Cue that prompts behavior (external or internal)
2. **Action** â€“ Simple behavior in anticipation of reward
3. **Variable Reward** â€“ Unpredictable feedback that builds engagement
4. **Investment** â€“ Effort that increases likelihood of returning
